  description: >
    GPULib enables users to access high performance computing with minimal
    modification to their existing programs. By providing bindings between
    Interactive Data Language (IDL) and large GPU libraries for general purpose
    computations, GPULib can accelerate new applications or be incorporated
    into existing applications with minimal effort. No knowledge of GPU
    programming or memory management is required.

  description: >
    Often experiments and simulations generate large amounts of data.
    Scientists exploring fluid and particle dynamics, high-energy and plasma
    physics, astrophysics and space sciences, biophysics, protein folding and
    medical science are challenged to visualize and analyze increasingly
    complex data. Many technical professionals rely on the Interactive Data
    Language (IDL) from Exelis Visual Information Solutions to visualize and
    analyze these large data sets. However some analyses cannot be practically
    accomplished on a workstation or server with only symmetric
    multi-processing. And while distributed memory parallel processing promises
    cost-effective computing power, IDL alone does not naturally take advantage
    of this parallel environment.

    To bridge the gap between IDL and parallel computing, Tech-X Corporation
    has developed FastDL. With FastDL scientists and developers can run IDL
    visualization and analysis applications in parallel on a series of
    networked computers â€“ significantly shortening the time required to get
    results.

  name: A Rapid Model Fitting Tool Suite (RMFT)
  description: >
    Instruments flown on board NASA missions often do not measure quantities
    of interest to scientists directly, but rather observable quantities. In
    addition, instruments often introduce artifacts into the data and
    techniques are needed to remove them. In both cases, scientifically
    relevant information can be inferred by simulating a parameterized model
    and adjusting the parameters to best match observed data. This minimization
    process of "fitting" a model to data is computationally demanding, since it
    requires evaluating the often complex models many times and minimizing a
    function of many variables. Fast, more efficient fitting techniques are
    therefore required in order to fully harvest the scientific output from
    NASA missions.

    In this project, we developed a fast, general-purpose parameter fitting
    software tool suite taking advantage of inexpensive, high-performance
    graphics processing units (GPUs). The goal of Phase I of this project is to
    demonstrate the feasibility of model fitting on GPUs. We will therefore
    prototype forward models, relevant mathematical operators and the actual
    parameter adjustment algorithm on GPUs and compare their performance to a
    pure CPU implementation. We will particularly focus on ease of use for the
    scientist to migrate their applications to this infrastructure.

  name: Remote Data Exploration with IDL (RDL)
  description: >
    The DAP protocol provides a discipline-neutral means of requesting and
    providing data across the World Wide Web. We built a library of routines,
    including a graphical user interface, for IDL allowing a user-friendly
    experience to seamlessly retrieve remote data with the DAP standard. The
    library was also integrated with a parallel computing library.

  name: IDLdoc
  description: >
    IDLdoc generates nicely formatted API documentation directly from IDL
    source code. If the documentation is kept close to the code itself is much
    more likely to be kept up-to-date. As much as possible the documentation
    produced by IDLdoc is generated directly from the source code, making
    IDLdoc useful even if there are no specially formatted comments at all in
    the source code.

  name: mgunit
  description: >
    mgunit is a unit testing framework modeled on other xUnit testing
    frameworks. The goal is to allow easy creation and reporting of results of
    tests, while still allowing for many different testing situations. Simple
    naming conventions replace formal creation of hierarchies and specification
    of tests. This allows test suites to be created with a minimum of code
    beyond the actual code of the tests themselves.

  name: rIDL
  description: >
    The Really Interactive Data Language (rIDL) provides a command line
    interface for IDL with more interactive features. Completion on filenames,
    variables, routines, system variables, reserved words, and executive
    commands allows users to quickly explore possibilities. rIDL also provides
    a richer set of other features including output logging and advanced
    history handling.
