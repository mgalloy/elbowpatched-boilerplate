intro:
  title: Hello!
  body: >
    I am a software developer at NCAR High Altitude Observatory (HAO). I work
    on the data pipelines for Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (MLSO).
    
    Previously, I was a research mathematician at Tech-X Corporation, working
    in the areas of high-performance computing, general purpose computing on
    graphics processing units (GPGPU), and visualization, especially as applied
    to the earth sciences.
    
    Before Tech-X, I taught scientists to use the Interactive Date Language
    (IDL) at RSI, now [Exelis VIS](http://www.exelisvis.com).
